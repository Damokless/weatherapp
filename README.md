# 👨‍💻 My opinion
I loved doing this little project to test nextui as a component library. I think the library has potential, but it's still too young and there aren't enough components for a bigger project.

I'm having quite a bit of trouble finishing the project, for lack of time and above all for lack of dev desire/motivation, but I'm glad I did it, it adds another project to my portfolio.
# 📋 To-do

- [x] mobile resposive
- [ ] Maybe a better way to handle the data ( context ?? )
